# The_INTERNET_OF_AGENTS_HACKATHON
# 🌍 AI-Powered Travel Agent  
### Built for *The Internet of Agents Hackathon @ Solana Skyline (Sept 14–21, 2025)*  

An AI-powered **travel booking assistant** that lets users **speak with an agent (voice → AI)**, get **flight/hotel recommendations**, and **pay with crypto** via Crossmint.  
The system is orchestrated using **Coral Protocol** to connect multiple agents seamlessly.

## 💡 Solution  
Our **AI-Powered Travel Agent** solves these issues by:  
- Using **voice interaction** to make booking fast & natural.  
- Providing **AI-based personalized recommendations** for flights & hotels.  
- Enabling **crypto payments via Crossmint** for modern, borderless transactions.  
- Orchestrating all agents with **Coral Protocol** into one smooth pipeline.
