## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### **1. Voice-Powered AI Agent**
```typescript
// Users can speak naturally to search and book flights
const handleVoiceCommand = async (command: string) => {
  if (command.includes("find flights to Tokyo")) {
    await searchFlights("Tokyo");
  } else if (command.includes("book this flight")) {
    await bookSelectedFlight();
  }
};
```

### **2. AI-Powered Recommendations**
```typescript
// Get intelligent travel suggestions
const recommendations = await services.recommendation.getRecommendations({
  query: "I want a relaxing beach vacation",
  preferences: {
    budget: { min: 1000, max: 3000, currency: "USD" },
    interests: ["beach", "relaxation", "spa"]
  }
});
```

### **3. Crypto Payment Integration**
```typescript
// Secure crypto payments via Crossmint
const payment = await services.payment.createPayment({
  amount: flight.price,
  currency: "USDC",
  paymentMethod: { type: "crypto" },
  customerEmail: user.email
});
```

### **4. Agent Orchestration**
```typescript
// Coordinate multiple AI agents
const response = await services.coral.orchestrateAgents({
  userQuery: { text: "Book me a flight to Paris" },
  sessionId,
  context: { preferences, history }
});
```

## 🔧 Configuration & Environment

### **Environment Variables** (`.env.example`)
